# CDI vs Bovespa

I developed the code and data in this repository to use in my [blog post](http://luizsol.com/ibov-vs-cdi/).

Fell free to use the code and data in any way you see fit.

Running the [`main.py`](src/main.py) script took my computer about 30 minutes and 10 GB of RAM, and it generates a file of about 2.1 GB. This file is not included here due to it's size.

## Code

All code is available [here](code).

## Data

Some data was scrapped and download, and some data was generated from the original data. All used data is available [here](data).

### Data source

* CDI data: [Calculadora do Cidad√£o - Banco Central do Brasil](https://www3.bcb.gov.br/CALCIDADAO/publico/exibirFormCorrecaoValores.do?method=exibirFormCorrecaoValores&aba=5)
